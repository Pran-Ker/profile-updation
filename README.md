1. Use ReactJS as the UI library to build this page.
2. Write the JavaScript code using React for displaying the profile, allowing edits and previewing them instantly on the side. You can add the display name and phone number to the right side bar.
3. If the user clicks save changes, it should persist to the database via the service call.
4. Please add a reset button to get the data back to the unmodified state (as it was before user changes).
5. Try implementing the profile picture upload functionality.
6. Build a microservice to create and update the user profile details.
7. Deploy both the frontend page and the microservice on Netlify/Heroku.
